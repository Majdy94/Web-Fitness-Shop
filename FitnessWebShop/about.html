            Calisthenics, free body exercises performed with varying degrees of intensity and rhythm,<br>
            which may or may not be done with light handheld apparatuses such as rings and wands. The exercises employ such motions as bending, stretching, twisting, swinging, kicking, and jumping,<br>
             as well as such specialized movements as push-ups, sit-ups, and chin-ups.
            Calisthenics promote strength,<br>
             endurance, flexibility, and coordination and augment the body’s general well-being by placing controllable, regular demands upon the cardiovascular system. The exercises can function as physique builders or serve as warm-ups for more-strenuous sports or exertions.
